# `iCal Ink Fetcher`

iCalInkFetcher is a utility to download iCal events, from iCal or CalDav calendars, and compile them into a list.  
This list is later saved as an image, and is used to update an ePaper display.  
You may find it useful for reference (how to use CalDav or iCal in your projects, for instance) or maybe even for an ePaper display of your own.
